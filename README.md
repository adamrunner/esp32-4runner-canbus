# ESP32 4Runner CAN Bus

ESP32-based CAN bus display and logger for a Toyota 4Runner using ESP-IDF and LVGL.
Logs raw CAN traffic to SD card while polling/decoding OBD-II and Toyota-specific PIDs.

Is mostly an effort to understand the CAN bus protocol and the Toyota 4Runner's CAN messages, especially the broadcast messages.
